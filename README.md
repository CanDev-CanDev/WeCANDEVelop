Server backend on Microsoft Azure SQL Database  
Backup database on Gearhost: den1.mssql3.gear.host  

Notes:
- Microsoft Azure SQL Database will be taken down after the trial period is over
- PHP files may be modified to point to Gearhost database if functionality is to be restored
- Gearhost database has high error rates
- It may be possible to run the programs locally using PHP 7 provided the server is online,
however we did not do so on the public uOttawa WIFI due to connectivity issues
